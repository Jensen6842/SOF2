# Software 2: Object Oriented Data Structures &amp; Algorithms

## Description
Students begin to program key data structures such as stacks, queues, trees and graphs. <br />
They are introduced to the idea of complexity of an algorithm, and how to characterise time and space through formal notations and proof techniques. <br />
Students are taught using an object oriented language like Java, and learn the basics of test driven development for testing their code and demonstrating its successful running. <br />
Students are also introduced to several algorithm design paradigms such as greedy algorithms.
